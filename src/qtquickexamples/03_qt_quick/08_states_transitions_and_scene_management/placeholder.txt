7. States, Transitions, and Scene Management

: Basic State change

Description: Define and switch between states in an Item, changing properties like color or position per state.
Hints for implementation: states: [ State { name: "active"; PropertyChanges { target: rect; color: "green" } } ]; set state: "active".

: When condition

Description: Apply states conditionally with 'when' clauses based on property values or expressions.
Hints for implementation: State { when: slider.value > 50; ... }. Auto-applies on condition change.

: StateGroup multiple

Description: Use StateGroup to manage independent state sets that can activate simultaneously.
Hints for implementation: StateGroup { states: [ ... ]; StateGroup { states: [ ... ] } }.

: Transition basics

Description: Define a Transition to animate between any state changes with specified animations.
Hints for implementation: transitions: [ Transition { from: ""; to: ""; ColorAnimation { ... } } ].

: PropertyChanges

Description: Use PropertyChanges within a State to modify multiple properties on targets.
Hints for implementation: State { PropertyChanges { target: [rect1, rect2]; color: "red" } }.

: Reversible transition

Description: Make transitions reversible to mirror animations when returning to previous states.
Hints for implementation: Transition { reversible: true; ... }. Works with symmetric from/to.

: StateChangeScript

Description: Execute JavaScript scripts on state entry or exit using StateChangeScript.
Hints for implementation: State { StateChangeScript { name: "enter"; script: console.log("Entered") } }.

: Nested states

Description: Create hierarchical states where child states extend or override parent ones.
Hints for implementation: State { name: "parent"; State { name: "child"; extend: "parent"; ... } }.

: Scene graph renderer

Description: Configure the scene graph renderer backend for software or threaded rendering.
Hints for implementation: In Python: os.environ["QSG_RENDERER"] = "software"; before engine.load.

: Item layer effects

Description: Enable layering on Items for caching and anti-aliasing in complex scenes.
Hints for implementation: layer.enabled: true; layer.samples: 16 for AA; layer.textureSize if needed.

: Dynamic state create

Description: Dynamically add states to an item's states array at runtime using JavaScript.
Hints for implementation: item.states.push(newState); where newState is a State object.

: Python state control

Description: Change QML states from Python by accessing the root object and setting the state property.
Hints for implementation: root = engine.rootObjects()[0]; root.setProperty("state", "newState").

: Transition with anim

Description: Embed complex animations like Sequential inside a Transition for state changes.
Hints for implementation: Transition { SequentialAnimation { ... } }.

: Error state fallback

Description: Define a fallback state triggered on errors, like network failure, to show messages.
Hints for implementation: State { when: errorCondition; PropertyChanges { target: label; text: "Error!" } }.

: Scene graph custom

Description: Extend the scene graph with custom nodes via Python/C++ for low-level rendering control.
Hints for implementation: Subclass QSGGeometryNode in Python; add to QSGNode tree via custom Item.
