    <h1>Pandas Exercises for Qt Applications: Progressive Data Manipulation</h1>
    <p>These 15 exercises guide developers building Qt apps (using PyQt or PySide) through pandas data manipulation, progressing from beginner to advanced concepts. Each focuses on one pandas feature, keeps code short for a single-file implementation, and integrates with Qt for data-centric apps. Inspired by real-world user projects like Stack Overflow discussions on DataFrame-to-QTableView integration and a Qiita article visualizing Shinkansen history, they highlight why pandas outperforms Qt's built-in models (e.g., QStandardItemModel) for data tasks.</p>

    <h2>Exercise 1: Loading and Displaying CSV Data</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Create a Qt app to load a small CSV (e.g., columns: name, age, city) and display it in a QTableView.</p>
    <h3>Hints</h3>
    <p>Read the CSV into a DataFrame. Create a QAbstractTableModel to map DataFrame rows/columns to the view. Set headers from DataFrame columns.</p>
    <h3>Why Pandas?</h3>
    <p>Qt's QFile requires manual CSV parsing, which is error-prone for malformed files. Pandas handles CSV variations (e.g., encoding, delimiters) automatically, as users note for quick prototyping.</p>

    <h2>Exercise 2: Sorting Data by Column</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Build a Qt app to load a CSV of products (name, price, stock) and sort by price in a QTableView using a button toggle (ascending/descending).</p>
    <h3>Hints</h3>
    <p>Use DataFrame sort_values with an ascending parameter. Update the table model on button click. Connect QPushButton to toggle the sort direction.</p>
    <h3>Why Pandas?</h3>
    <p>Qt's QSortFilterProxyModel sorts visually but doesn’t modify the underlying data. Pandas’ sort_values is simpler and preserves data integrity, avoiding Qt’s complex proxy setup.</p>

    <h2>Exercise 3: Filtering Rows by Value</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Create a Qt app to load a CSV of students (name, grade, subject) and filter rows where grade > 80 using a checkbox, showing results in a QTableView.</p>
    <h3>Hints</h3>
    <p>Use boolean indexing (e.g., df[df['grade'] > 80]). Toggle the filtered DataFrame in the model when the checkbox changes.</p>
    <h3>Why Pandas?</h3>
    <p>Qt’s proxy models require regex or custom filters, which are verbose. Pandas’ boolean indexing is concise and intuitive, as seen in user apps filtering datasets.</p>

    <h2>Exercise 4: Adding a Derived Column</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Develop a Qt app to load a CSV of employees (name, salary) and add a column for bonus (10% of salary), displaying in a QTableView.</p>
    <h3>Hints</h3>
    <p>Create a new column with a simple calculation (e.g., df['bonus'] = df['salary'] * 0.1). Refresh the table model to include the new column.</p>
    <h3>Why Pandas?</h3>
    <p>Qt models require manual item insertion for new columns, which is tedious. Pandas’ vectorized operations are faster and cleaner, as users report for quick calculations.</p>

    <h2>Exercise 5: Handling Missing Values</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Build a Qt app to load a CSV of weather data (date, temp) with missing temps, fill them with the mean, and show in a QTableView.</p>
    <h3>Hints</h3>
    <p>Use fillna with the column mean. Update the model post-cleaning. Add a button to trigger the fill operation.</p>
    <h3>Why Pandas?</h3>
    <p>Qt lacks built-in missing value handling, requiring loops. Pandas’ fillna is a one-liner, efficient for datasets like sensor logs where users report 20% missing data.</p>

    <h2>Exercise 6: Grouping by Category</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Create a Qt app to load a CSV of sales (region, amount) and show total sales per region in a QTableView.</p>
    <h3>Hints</h3>
    <p>Use groupby on region and sum the amount. Display the aggregated DataFrame in the model. Use reset_index to format for the view.</p>
    <h3>Why Pandas?</h3>
    <p>Qt has no grouping tools, requiring manual aggregation. Pandas’ groupby is optimized, as seen in retail apps for quick regional summaries.</p>

    <h2>Exercise 7: Merging Two Datasets</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Develop a Qt app to merge two CSVs—customers (id, name) and orders (customer_id, order_date)—and display the joined data in a QTableView.</p>
    <h3>Hints</h3>
    <p>Use merge with an inner join on customer_id. Load the result into the model. Handle missing matches with a default value if needed.</p>
    <h3>Why Pandas?</h3>
    <p>Qt’s QSql requires a database, which is overkill for CSV joins. Pandas’ merge is straightforward, as users note in CRM apps for avoiding manual ID lookups.</p>

    <h2>Exercise 8: Dropping Duplicate Rows</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Create a Qt app to load a CSV of user logs (user_id, action, timestamp) with duplicates, remove them, and show the cleaned data in a QTableView.</p>
    <h3>Hints</h3>
    <p>Use drop_duplicates with subset columns (e.g., user_id, action). Update the model after deduplication. Add a button to trigger the action.</p>
    <h3>Why Pandas?</h3>
    <p>Qt lacks deduplication tools, requiring manual checks. Pandas’ drop_duplicates is fast and flexible, saving time in log analysis apps per user feedback.</p>

    <h2>Exercise 9: Converting Data Types</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Build a Qt app to load a CSV of sensor data (timestamp, value as string) and convert values to floats for display in a QTableView.</p>
    <h3>Hints</h3>
    <p>Use astype or to_numeric for conversion, handling errors with coerce. Refresh the model post-conversion.</p>
    <h3>Why Pandas?</h3>
    <p>Qt’s string-to-number parsing is manual and error-prone. Pandas’ type conversion is robust, as users report for cleaning messy IoT data.</p>

    <h2>Exercise 10: Applying a Custom Function</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Develop a Qt app to load a CSV of products (name, price) and categorize prices as "Low" or "High" (>50) in a new column, shown in a QTableView.</p>
    <h3>Hints</h3>
    <p>Use apply with a lambda to categorize prices. Update the model to include the new column.</p>
    <h3>Why Pandas?</h3>
    <p>Qt requires manual iteration for custom logic. Pandas’ apply simplifies row-wise operations, as seen in e-commerce apps for quick categorization.</p>

    <h2>Exercise 11: Pivoting Data for Summary</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Create a Qt app to load a CSV of sales (region, month, amount) and pivot to show regions as rows, months as columns, and amounts as values in a QTableView.</p>
    <h3>Hints</h3>
    <p>Use pivot_table with region as index and month as columns. Load the pivoted DataFrame into the model.</p>
    <h3>Why Pandas?</h3>
    <p>Qt has no pivoting tools, requiring complex model restructuring. Pandas’ pivot_table is ideal for summary views, as users note in dashboard apps.</p>

    <h2>Exercise 12: Resampling Time Series Data</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Build a Qt app to load a CSV of hourly stock prices (timestamp, price), resample to daily averages, and display in a QTableView.</p>
    <h3>Hints</h3>
    <p>Set timestamp as index and use resample with mean. Update the model with the resampled DataFrame.</p>
    <h3>Why Pandas?</h3>
    <p>Qt lacks time-series tools, requiring manual datetime grouping. Pandas’ resample is efficient, as used in financial apps for quick trends.</p>

    <h2>Exercise 13: Computing Rolling Averages</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Develop a Qt app to load a CSV of daily temperatures (date, temp), compute a 7-day rolling average, and show both columns in a QTableView.</p>
    <h3>Hints</h3>
    <p>Use rolling with a 7-day window and mean. Add the result as a new column and update the model.</p>
    <h3>Why Pandas?</h3>
    <p>Qt requires custom loops for rolling calculations. Pandas’ rolling is optimized, as seen in weather apps for smoothing time series.</p>

    <h2>Exercise 14: Calculating Correlations</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Create a Qt app to load a CSV of experiment data (variable1, variable2, variable3), compute pairwise correlations, and display in a QTableView.</p>
    <h3>Hints</h3>
    <p>Use corr to get the correlation matrix. Flatten it with stack and load into the model for display.</p>
    <h3>Why Pandas?</h3>
    <p>Qt lacks statistical tools, requiring external libraries. Pandas’ corr integrates seamlessly, as users note in research GUIs for quick stats.</p>

    <h2>Exercise 15: Conditional Formatting in Table</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Build a Qt app to load a CSV of test scores (name, score), highlight scores > 90 in a QTableView with color, and show a count of high scores in a QLabel.</p>
    <h3>Hints</h3>
    <p>Create a boolean mask for scores > 90. Use QAbstractTableModel’s data method with Qt.BackgroundRole to set colors. Count matches with sum for the label.</p>
    <h3>Why Pandas?</h3>
    <p>Qt’s styling is manual and view-based. Pandas’ boolean operations simplify logic, as seen in educational apps for highlighting key metrics.</p>
