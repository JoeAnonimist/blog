    <h1>Asyncio Exercises for Qt Applications</h1>
    <p>These exercises progress from basic to advanced concepts, each designed for short, single-file implementations.</p>
    
<ol>
    <li>
        <h3>Basic Async Sleep in a Responsive UI</h3>
        <p>Adapt a simple Qt "Hello World" button that triggers an async delay before updating a label, demonstrating non-blocking waits without freezing the interface.</p>
        <h4>Hints for implementation:</h4>
        <p>Use a library to bridge asyncio and Qt event loops; define a coroutine that awaits a sleep and emits a signal to update the UI upon completion.</p>
        <h4>Explanation why using Python asyncio is appropriate:</h4>
        <p>As seen in early Stack Overflow discussions on integrating asyncio with PyQt5 for responsive GUIs during waits, asyncio prevents UI freezes from synchronous sleeps, outperforming QTimer for cooperative multitasking in simple delay scenarios without thread overhead.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <h3>Async Slot for Button Click</h3>
