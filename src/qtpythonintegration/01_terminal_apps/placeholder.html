    <h1>Comprehensive List of Exercises for Learning PySide6 Terminal (Non-GUI) Apps</h1>
    
    <h2>Beginner Exercises</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Hello World Console App</strong><br>
        Create a basic terminal application that prints "Hello, World!" using QCoreApplication to initialize the Qt event loop, demonstrating the foundation for non-GUI PySide6 apps.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Command-Line Argument Parsing</strong><br>
        Build a CLI tool that accepts and processes command-line flags (e.g., --verbose, --output-file) using QCommandLineParser, mimicking simple script utilities like file processors.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Basic Event Loop Management</strong><br>
        Develop a console app that runs an event loop with QCoreApplication.exec() and handles a quit signal (e.g., via Ctrl+C), reflecting core event handling in long-running terminal tools.
        </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Intermediate Exercises</h2>
    <ol start="4">
        <li><strong>Signals and Slots in Console</strong><br>
        Implement a producer-consumer pattern in the terminal where one object emits a signal (e.g., data ready) and another slot processes it, useful for decoupled logic in CLI data pipelines.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Timers for Periodic Tasks</strong><br>
        Create a countdown timer app that prints status updates at intervals using QTimer, simulating scheduled tasks in monitoring tools like system health checkers.
        </li>
        <li><strong>File Reading and Writing</strong><br>
        Write a file copier utility that reads from one file and writes to another using QFile and QTextStream, handling errors for robust data migration scripts.
        </li>
        <li><strong>JSON Data Handling</strong><br>
        Build a JSON validator and pretty-printer that loads, parses, and outputs formatted JSON from stdin or files using QJsonDocument, common in API response processors.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Configuration Management</strong><br>
        Develop a settings loader that reads INI-style configs with QSettings and applies them to app behavior (e.g., log level), as seen in configurable CLI deployers.
        </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Advanced Exercises</h2>
    <ol start="9">
        <li><strong>Networking: HTTP Client</strong><br>
        Construct a simple HTTP GET client using QNetworkAccessManager to fetch and display web content in the terminal, emulating download tools like wget wrappers.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Threading for Concurrent Operations</strong><br>
        Create a multi-threaded file scanner using QThread that processes directories in parallel and reports results via signals, for performance-critical tasks like backup verifiers.
        </li>
        <li><strong>External Process Execution</strong><br>
        Build a task runner that spawns and monitors subprocesses with QProcess (e.g., running shell commands and capturing output), similar to build scripts in CI/CD pipelines.
        </li>
        <li><strong>TCP Server for Local Services</strong><br>
        Implement a basic echo server using QTcpServer that listens on a port and responds to client connections in the console, modeling lightweight local daemons.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Logging and Debugging</strong><br>
        Enhance a data processor with structured logging using QLoggingCategory, outputting levels (debug/info/error) to file or console, essential for production CLI utilities.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Internationalization Support</strong><br>
        Localize a multi-language CLI tool using QTranslator and QString for translatable strings, handling locale switches via args, for global deployment scripts.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Single-Instance Enforcement</strong><br>
        Extend a file locker app to ensure only one instance runs using QSharedMemory or QtSingleCoreApplication, preventing conflicts in shared resource managers.
        </li>
    </ol>
