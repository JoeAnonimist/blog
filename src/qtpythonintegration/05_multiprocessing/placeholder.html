    <h1>Exercises for Using Python's Multiprocessing in Qt Applications</h1>
    <p>These exercises are designed to illustrate scenarios in PyQt or PySide applications where CPU-intensive tasks cause the GUI to freeze due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). In each case, we'll use <code>multiprocessing</code> to offload work to separate processes, keeping the main thread responsive. I've drawn from common real-world user experiences, such as Stack Overflow threads where developers reported GUI blocking during heavy computations (e.g., data processing in a file analyzer app) or Reddit discussions on slow CPU-bound operations in GUI tools, adapting them into simple, focused demos. Each exercise includes a brief setup, implementation hints, and an explanation of why <code>multiprocessing</code> is preferable to Qt's <code>QProcess</code>.</p>

<h2>Exercise 1: Parallel Fibonacci Sequence Computation</h2>
<h3>Setup:</h3>
<p>Create a PyQt window with a button that triggers the computation of the first 40 Fibonacci numbers (a classic CPU-bound task due to recursive or iterative calculations). Display the results in a text area. Without parallelism, clicking the button freezes the GUI for seconds.</p>

<h3>Hints for Implementation:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Define a target function that computes a subset of the Fibonacci sequence (e.g., split the range into chunks for each process).</li>
    <li>Use <code>multiprocessing.Pool</code> to distribute chunks across 4 processes, then collect and combine results in the main thread.</li>
    <li>Connect the button's clicked signal to a slot that starts the pool, shows a progress dialog, and updates the text area upon completion using signals for thread-safe GUI updates.</li>
    <li>Handle pool termination with a callback or <code>pool.close()</code> to avoid resource leaks.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why Multiprocessing Over QProcess?</h3>
<p><code>QProcess</code> is suited for launching external executables (e.g., a separate Python script via command line), but it introduces overhead from process startup, serialization, and inter-process communication via stdin/stdout—inefficient for quick, repeated Python-internal computations. Multiprocessing bypasses the GIL by spawning true OS processes running Python code directly, enabling parallel execution on multiple cores without freezing the Qt event loop. In real-world cases, like users on Stack Overflow building scientific calculators in PyQt, this prevented UI hangs during iterative math, unlike <code>QProcess</code> which would require cumbersome script wrappers.</p>

<h2>Exercise 2: Batch Image Resizing Tool</h2>
<h3>Setup:</h3>
<p>Build a simple image viewer app in PySide with a "Resize All" button that loads a directory of 20+ small PNG images (e.g., 1000x1000 pixels) and resizes them to thumbnails. Use a list widget to show progress; the task should complete in under 5 seconds on a multi-core machine.</p>

<h3>Hints for Implementation:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Write a worker function using Pillow (PIL) to resize a single image and return the path to the output file.</li>
    <li>Employ <code>multiprocessing.Queue</code> for task distribution: enqueue image paths, have worker processes dequeue and process, and use a results queue to gather outputs.</li>
    <li>In the GUI slot, start 6-8 worker processes via <code>Process(target=worker, args=(task_queue, result_queue))</code>, monitor queue sizes with a timer, and update the list widget via a custom signal when results arrive.</li>
    <li>Ensure processes join properly and handle exceptions by checking queue for poison pills (sentinel values).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why Multiprocessing Over QProcess?</h3>
<p>Qt's <code>QProcess</code> excels at running tools like ImageMagick externally but can't parallelize pure Python image manipulations efficiently—each image would need a separate subprocess call, leading to high I/O overhead and no GIL bypass for CPU-heavy ops like pixel transformations. Multiprocessing runs the resizing logic natively in parallel processes, leveraging all cores for true speedup. This mirrors experiences from Reddit users developing photo editors in PyQt, where single-threaded resizing caused 10x slowdowns on laptops; multiprocessing cut times dramatically without external dependencies.</p>

<h2>Exercise 3: Monte Carlo Pi Approximation Simulator</h2>
<h3>Setup:</h3>
<p>Develop a PyQt dashboard for a Monte Carlo simulation that estimates pi by throwing 10 million random darts at a unit circle. Include sliders for trial counts and a plot canvas (using matplotlib integration) to visualize convergence. The simulation should update the plot incrementally without blocking button interactions.</p>

<h3>Hints for Implementation:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Create a function that simulates a batch of darts (e.g., 1 million per process) and returns the hit count inside the circle.</li>
    <li>Use <code>multiprocessing.Pool.map</code> to parallelize batches across cores, summing results to compute pi.</li>
    <li>Trigger from a "Run Simulation" button: create the pool, map the function, then emit a signal with aggregated results to redraw the plot in the main thread.</li>
    <li>Add a progress bar by using <code>Pool.imap</code> for iterable results and updating via a QTimer that checks partial sums.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why Multiprocessing Over QProcess?</h3>
<p><code>QProcess</code> would require exporting the random simulation to a shell script or external binary, complicating data return (e.g., via files or pipes) and failing to parallelize the math-heavy random number generation within Python. Multiprocessing enables GIL-free parallelism for the CPU-bound dart throws, distributing work seamlessly. Drawing from Medium articles on scientific GUI tools, developers using PySide for simulations noted that multiprocessing halved computation times compared to threaded attempts, avoiding the "frozen spinner" issue that <code>QProcess</code> couldn't resolve without custom binaries.</p>

<h2>Exercise 4: Bulk File Hash Verifier</h2>
<h3>Setup:</h3>
<p>Design a file manager app in PyQt with a "Verify Integrity" button that computes SHA-256 hashes for a selected folder of 50 text files (simulating a data integrity checker). Display hashes in a table view, with a status bar for progress; aim for verification in 2-3 seconds.</p>

<h3>Hints for Implementation:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Define a hash function that reads a file and computes its SHA-256 using hashlib.</li>
    <li>Split the file list into chunks and use <code>multiprocessing.Pool.starmap</code> to process chunks in parallel, returning (filename, hash) tuples.</li>
    <li>In the button handler, start the pool, connect results to a slot that populates the table model row-by-row using <code>QTableWidget</code> signals.</li>
    <li>Use shared memory via <code>multiprocessing.Value</code> for a counter to drive the status bar updates across processes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why Multiprocessing Over QProcess?</h3>
<p>While <code>QProcess</code> could invoke <code>sha256sum</code> externally per file, it serializes calls (no built-in parallelism) and requires parsing output, adding latency for I/O-bound file reads mixed with CPU hashing. Multiprocessing handles the entire pipeline (read + hash) in parallel Python processes, bypassing GIL contention on hash computations. This is inspired by Stack Overflow queries from users building backup tools in PyQt, where multiprocessing sped up verification by 4x on SSDs, unlike <code>QProcess</code> which bogged down with subprocess management.</p>

<h2>Exercise 5: Parallel Data Chunk Analyzer</h2>
<h3>Setup:</h3>
<p>Create a data explorer app in PySide that loads a CSV file (e.g., 100k rows of random floats) and computes statistics like mean, variance, and max per column on button press. Use a tree view to show results hierarchically; keep the app responsive for resizing or menu actions during analysis.</p>

<h3>Hints for Implementation:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Implement an analysis function that processes a data chunk (subset of rows) using pandas for stats calculation.</li>
    <li>Divide the DataFrame into N chunks (N = cpu_count()) and use <code>multiprocessing.Pool.apply_async</code> for asynchronous submission, collecting futures for aggregation.</li>
    <li>From the GUI, load the CSV into a shared list of chunks, fire off async calls, and use a QThread or signal to poll results and merge stats (e.g., via numpy for sums).</li>
    <li>Terminate early if a "Cancel" button is pressed by closing the pool and joining processes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why Multiprocessing Over QProcess?</h3>
<p><code>QProcess</code> isn't designed for splitting and merging in-memory data structures like pandas DataFrames—it would need awkward temp file exports for each chunk, defeating parallelism. Multiprocessing allows direct Python object passing (via pickling) and GIL-free execution for vectorized ops, ideal for CPU-bound stats. Real-world parallels come from Analytics Vidhya tutorials and user posts on data viz apps in PyQt, where multiprocessing transformed sluggish single-core analysis into responsive tools, avoiding the overhead of external CSV processors like <code>QProcess</code>-launched awk or R scripts.</p></body>
